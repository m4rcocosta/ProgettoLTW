			<p>Ubuntu MATE is a free and open-source Linux distribution and an official derivative of Ubuntu. 
			is the youngest official Ubuntu derivative that uses MATE as a graphical environment. It isthe first 
			two releases, 14.10 and 14.04, were not official derivatives of Ubuntu, while the versions are from 15.04 onwards.
			Its main differentiation from Ubuntu is that it uses the MATE desktop environment as its default 
			user interface, based on GNOME 2 which was used for Ubuntu versions prior to 11.04, instead of 
			the Unity graphical shell that is the default user interface for the Ubuntu desktop, or GNOME 
			Shell starting with Ubuntu 17.10.<br />

            <p><h2>Features</h2><br />
           Ubuntu MATE is a stable, easy to use and highly configurable operating system, 
           ideal for those who want the most from their desktop, laptop or netbook, but prefer an interface 
           traditional graphics. The modest system requirements make Ubuntu MATE suitable for both old and new hardware.
           Ubuntu MATE is currently the only official Ubuntu derivative to be equipped with a welcome
           screen and provides a graphical software to install some of the most useful programs, not necessarily present 
           in the official Ubuntu repositories (for example, the Telegram messaging client). 
           Thanks to MATE Tweak you can customize the graphical environment, for example by changing the window 
           manager in Compiz or Compton to avoid screen tearing problems.
