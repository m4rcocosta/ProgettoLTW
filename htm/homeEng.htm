			<p>Welcome in LinuxPedia, let's go and see what's the best version for you!</p>
			First of all, we'll start with the introduction of <a href="https://www.linux.com/what-is-linux" title="Linux" target="_blank">Linux</a>.<br />
			Linux is, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" title="Wikipedia" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, an Unix-like operative 
			systems' family, published under possible various distributions built around the Linux kernel.
			We want to illustrate the little differences among the most diffused Linux workstation distributions.<br />
			Thanks to the Linux kernel portability, a wide range of operative systems has been developed, for a wide
			range of devices:

				<ul>
					<li>personal computer;</li>
					<li>mobile phones;</li>
					<li>mainframe;</li>
					<li>supercomputer.</li>
				</ul>

			Linux is really used, mostly as server operative system, in production environments or in <i>embedded</i>
			devices (PVR, telefoni, ecc.), and it has a sufficient diffusion in desktop environment (about 3% of PCs).
			Aside it's possible to select the chosen distribution, with its own page containing details and advices
			about use and installation.<br />
			First of all, however, it's important to understand <b>why</b> we advice to install a Linux distribution.<br/>
			Linux, in its different distributions, is a <b>free</b> software (<i>opensource</i>): this means that
			everyone can do copies of the software, analyze the source code and modify it.<br />
			On the other hand, Linux has a high <b>customizability</b>: you can choose the graphic environment and every
			graphic environment is developed for a scope.

			<p>Moreover, Linux is the only operative system designed and structured in a "<b>"safety"</b> way and that 
			allows a virus immunity near to 100%.<br />
			Finally, Linux is really <b>simple</b>: it has a graphic interface very similar to every other operative
			sistem. In fact, folders, copy and paste, browser are the same or very similar to the programs used on 
			Mac or Windows.</p>
