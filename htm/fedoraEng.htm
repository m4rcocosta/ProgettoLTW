		Fedora is a Unix-like operating system based on the Linux kernel and GNU programs (a Linux distribution), developed by the community-supported 
		Fedora Project and sponsored by the Red Hat company. Fedora contains software distributed under various free and open-source licenses and aims 
		to be on the leading edge of such technologies. Fedora is the upstream source of the commercial Red Hat Enterprise Linux distribution.
		Since the release of Fedora 21, three different editions are available: Workstation, focused on the personal computer, Server and Cloud for 
		servers, and Atomic being the edition meant for cloud computing.
		As of February 2016, Fedora has an estimated 1.2 million users, including Linus Torvalds, creator of the Linux kernel.<br /><br />
		<h1>Features</h1>
		Fedora has a reputation for focusing on innovation, integrating new technologies early on and working closely with upstream Linux communities. 
		Making changes upstream instead of specifically for Fedora ensures that the changes are available to all Linux distributions.
		Fedora has a relatively short life cycle: each version is usually supported for at least 13 months, where version X is supported only until 
		1 month after version X+2 is released and with approximately 6 months between most versions. Fedora users can upgrade from version to version 
		without reinstalling.
		The default desktop environment in Fedora is GNOME and the default user interface is the GNOME Shell. Other desktop environments, including 
		KDE Plasma, Xfce, LXDE, MATE and Cinnamon, are available and can be installed.<br />
