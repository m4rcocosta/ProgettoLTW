			<h1>DEBIAN</h1>

			<p>Debian is a Unix-like computer operating system that is composed entirely of free software, 
			most of which is under the GNU General Public License and packaged by a group of individuals
			participating in the Debian Project.

			The Debian Project was first announced in 1993 by Ian Murdock, Debian 0.01 was released on 
			September 15, 1993, and the first stable release was made in 1996.

			The Debian stable release branch is the most popular Debian edition for personal computers and 
			network servers, and has been used as a base for many other distributions.

			The project's work is carried out over the Internet by a team of volunteers guided by the Debian 
			Project Leader and three foundational documents: the Debian Social Contract, the Debian Constitution, 
			and the Debian Free Software Guidelines. New distributions are updated continually, and the next 
			candidate is released after a time-based freeze.

			As one of the earliest operating systems based on the Linux kernel, it was decided that Debian was 
			to be developed openly and freely distributed in the spirit of the GNU Project. This decision drew 
			the attention and support of the Free Software Foundation, which sponsored the project for one year 
			from November 1994 to November 1995. Upon the ending of the sponsorship, the Debian Project formed 
			the non-profit organisation Software in the Public Interest.

			While all Debian releases are derived from the GNU Operating System and use the GNU userland and the 
			GNU C Library (glibc), other kernels aside from the Linux kernel are also available, such as those based 
			on BSD kernels and the GNU Hurd microkernel.</p><br />
			
			<p><h2>Relases</h2><br />Stable version of Debian gets released approximately every 2 years. It will receive 
			official support for about 3 years with update for major security or usability fixes. Point releases will be 
			available every several months as determined by Stable Release Managers (SRM).

			Debian also launched its Long Term Support (LTS) project since Debian 6 (Debian Squeeze). For each Debian release, 
			it will receive two years of extra security updates provided by LTS Team after its End Of Life (EOL). 
			However, no point releases will be made. Now each Debian release can receive 5 years of security support in total.</p><br />
			 
			<p><h2>Features</h2><br />Debian has access to online repositories that contain over 
			50,000 software packages making it the largest software compilation. Debian officially contains 
			only free software, but non-free software can be downloaded and installed from the Debian 
			repositories. Debian includes popular free programs such as LibreOffice,[12] Firefox web browser, 
			Evolution mail, K3b disc burner, VLC media player, GIMP image editor, and Evince document viewer. 
			Debian is a popular choice for web servers (cf. LAMP).
