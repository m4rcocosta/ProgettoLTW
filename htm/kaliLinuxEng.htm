			<p>Kali Linux is a Debian-derived Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and 
			penetration testing. It is maintained and funded by Offensive Security Ltd. Mati Aharoni, 
			Devon Kearns and Raphaël Hertzog are the core developers.

			Kali Linux has a dedicated project set aside for compatibility and porting to specific Android devices, 
			called Kali Linux NetHunter.

			It is the first Open Source Android penetration testing platform for Nexus devices, created as a joint 
			effort between the Kali community member “BinkyBear” and Offensive Security. It supports Wireless 802.11 
			frame injection, one-click MANA Evil Access Point setups, HID keyboard (Teensy like attacks), as well 
			as Bad USB MITM attacks.

			BackTrack (Kali's predecessor) contained a mode known as forensic mode, which was carried over to Kali 
			via live boot. This mode is very popular for many reasons, partly because many Kali users already have 
			a bootable Kali USB drive or CD, and this option makes it easy to apply Kali to a forensic job. When 
			booted in forensic mode, the system doesn't touch the internal hard drive or swap space and auto mounting 
			is disabled. However, the developers recommend that users test these features extensively before using Kali 
			for real world forensics.</p><br />
