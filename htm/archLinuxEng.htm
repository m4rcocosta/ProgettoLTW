			<h1>ARCH LINUX</h1>
			<img src="../img/logoArchLinux.png" title="Arch Linux's logo" id="logoArchLinux"><br />
			Arch Linux is a Linux distribution for computers based on x86-64 architectures.
			Arch Linux is composed predominantly of free and open-source software, and supports community involvement.
			The design approach of the development team follows the KISS principle ("keep it simple, stupid") as the general guideline, and focuses on 
			elegance, code correctness, minimalism and simplicity, and expects the user to be willing to make some effort to understand the system's 
			operation. A package manager written specifically for Arch Linux, pacman, is used to install, remove and update software packages.
			Arch Linux uses a rolling release model, such that a regular system update is all that is needed to obtain the latest Arch software; the 
			installation images released by the Arch team are simply up-to-date snapshots of the main system components.
			Arch Linux has comprehensive documentation in the form of a community wiki, called the ArchWiki. The wiki is widely regarded among the 
			Linux community and ecosystem for often having the most recent information on a specific topic and being applicable beyond Arch Linux.<br /><br />
			<h1>Features</h1>
			Precisely because of its minimalist philosophy, the basic installation does not incorporate any instrument of
			automatic configuration, no desktop environment and no other program or tool than it is
			strictly necessary at system start-up; for this it is not suitable for new users of
			GNU / Linux or those who do not want to deal with the command shell.<br />
			Some salient features of the distribution are:
			<div class="lista">
			<ul>
			<li>lightness: for this reason some portions of the system such as /usr/doc and the info pages, considered useless, have been eliminated, given that the same information can be obtained on the Net;</li>
			<li>simplicity: the init system used by Arch is strongly inspired by that of BSD, and all configurations are assigned to small text files;</li>
			<li>modernity: Arch Linux is a rolling release distribution. All the packages available for installation are always updated to the latest version distributed by the authors (after testing phase). This makes it unsuitable for use in the production server area;</li>
			<li>speed: ArchLinux is optimized for i686 and x86-64 architecture. Other architectures (such as i586) are kept (unofficially) by the community.</li>
			</ul>
			</div>

			Arch Linux offers a very simple and extremely convenient package management system. Packages
			binaries are managed thanks to pacman which takes care of both the synchronization between the local repository and
			official ones of installation, removal and updating. Pacman is the consideration of
			dpkg and apt-get for Debian and derivatives, like Ubuntu, or dnf for Red Hat Linux, Fedora or CentOS.<br />
			Arch Linux is equipped with a BSD-style port system, called ABS (Arch Linux Build System).
			Creating a package with ABS is pretty simple: just create a file (the PKGBUILD) containing it
			the instructions needed to download the sources and compile them with a single command, makepkg.
			This allows anyone to package software that is not yet available officially, by delegating
			to the package manager the task of the installation/removal management.
