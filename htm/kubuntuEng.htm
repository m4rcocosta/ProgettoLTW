			<h1>KUBUNTU</h1>
			<img id="logoDistro" src="../img/logoKubuntu.png" title="logo di Kubuntu"><br />
			<p>Kubuntu is an official Ubuntu distribution using the KDE desktop environment instead of Unity. 
			It is supported by the KDE and Kubuntu.org communities.<br />

            <p><h2>Features</h2><br />
            The release of a new version takes place at the same time to the release of a new version of Ubuntu, 
            and as such marked by X.Y animal adjective (where X represents the last two digits of the year of 
            distribution and Y is the month: 
			04 (April) for stable versions and 10 (October) for those switching between one building and the next). Funded by the 
			companies Canonical Ltd (registered in the Isle of Man) and Blue Systems, this system is distributed as 
			free software under the GNU GPL license and is free and freely editable.
            Kubuntu is available both as a Live distribution and as an installation for the Intel 80x86 and AMD64 platforms,
            and the PowerPC up to 2006. There are also daily CD builds, and it is developed in a coordinated way with Ubuntu 
            and all the packages are shared in the same archive and can be downloaded from the muon package manager.
            The installed programs are managed through a centralized system, called package management, typical of a GNU / Linux operating 
            system. Specifically also Kubuntu uses APT, also "inherited" from Debian. For the user this system is transparent. 
            It keeps track of the new versions available for every installed program and updates them accordingly.
            After the upgrade it is not necessary to restart the computer, except for any changes to the kernel 
            (the heart of the operating system).
            To update it to a new release version, just open the terminal and type Sudo apt-get upgrade.</p><br />

			<p><h2>Security</h2><br />
			
			A feature of Kubuntu, due to the GNU / Linux architecture, is its resistance to malicious programs like viruses, 
			adware, spyware or malware. In fact, the architecture of a GNU / Linux operating system leaves little or no scope 
			for a harmful program. Even if a malicious program exploited a flaw, the architecture of the operating system 
			would prevent its use, at least in the vast majority of cases.
			In addition, these malicious programs are generally developed for Microsoft Windows, which has a wider distribution.
            The user uses an account with limited permissions. This reduces the danger of installed programs.To perform administrative tasks, 
            you are asked for your password to confirm the operation.
            Choosing free applications from the official repositories is very unlikely to find malware applications, 
            since any malicious code would almost certainly be noticed and eliminated.
            </p><br />
            
            <p><h2>Stability</h2><br />
            Kubuntu is based on the Linux kernel and this makes it very stable. For example, it does not suffer 
            from file system fragmentation problems, or the installation or uninstallation of applications does not 
            dirty the system or slow down its start or shutdown.
            The operating system is also resistant: an eventual crash of an application, in the major operating 
            system is also resistant: an eventual crash of an application, in most cases, does not block the whole system 
            part of the cases, does not block the whole system.</p><br />
            
            <p><h2>Official repositories</h2><br />
            All the freely installable software on Kubuntu is divided into four large components. 
            These components are managed by the developers and allow the installation of software starting 
            from a single secure site, without having to search on the internet.
            They are also called Software Sources and also serve to highlight the differences in licenses and support available. 
            The official components of Ubuntu are Main, Restricted, Universe and Multiverse 
            (respectively Main, Restricted, Universe and Multiverse)
            A classic installation includes packages belonging only to the Main and Restricted components. 
            To install the other components just select them in the Software Sources preferences.
            </p><br />
            
            <p><h3>Main</h3><br />
            Only free software is included in this component and is fully supported by the development team. 
            The included software meets the Ubuntu licensing requirements; they therefore use a free license 
            approved by the Free Software Foundation. Technical support and security updates are guaranteed 
            for the entire version support period.
            The Main component can still contain firmware and fonts, used by the free software of Main, 
            which can not be modified without the permission of their authors. The redistribution of what 
            is included in Main is guaranteed.
            </p><br />
			
			<p><h3>Restricted</h3><br />
			The component includes programs and features that are widely used but not available with a fully 
			free license. In most cases it is proprietary software, such as video card drivers or other types 
			of hardware. The development team may not provide full support given the absence of the source code.
			</p><br />
			
			<p><h3>Universe</h3><br />
			This component includes most of the free programs in circulation, with different types of licenses, 
			but it is not supported directly by the Kubuntu team. The purpose of this component is to provide 
			easy access to free software without forcing the user to search the Internet or compile the source code. 
			If a program is liked by the user, the team can decide to move it and support it in the Main component 
			in the next version of Ubuntu.
			</p><br />
			
			<p><h3>Multiverse</h3><br />
			Component that collects non-free software, called non-free, such as the Adobe Flash plugin or MP3 support, 
			which is not supported by the development team. Since these plugins are developed without the regular payment 
			of the licenses of the producers who hold the rights of the relative formats (as in the case of the mp3 plugin, 
			which is developed for free, thus violating the Fraunhofer commercial license on the mp3 format),
			when installing one of these plug-ins, the user is warned of the possibility that the legislation of their 
			own country may prohibit the use of such software, as it is formally illegal and causes violation of proprietary licenses. 
			There are no official ISO images already provided with non-free components, so using the discs burned 
			in live mode will not be able to play the multimedia files that require such codecs, and 
			the visualization of the websites will be missing the visualization of the parts in Flash.

			<p><h2>Most relevant versions</h2><br />
			
			<p><h3>HOARY HEDGEHOG</h3><br />
			The first version of Kubuntu, 5.04, was published on April 8, 2005. Called "Hoary Hedgehog" ("Riccio Veterano"), 
			includes KDE 3.4 and a selection of the most useful programs for KDE, such as: amaroK, Kaffeine and Gwenview .</p><br />
			
			<p><h3>GUTSY GIBBON</h3><br />
			Kubuntu version 7.10 called Gutsy Gibbon ("Gibbone Coraggioso") was released on October 18, 2007
			and presents further news compared to 7.04: KDE 3.5.8 (penultimate version of the 3 series, before 
			the KDE 4 release on 11 January 2008) and more hardware support thanks to the new 2.6.22 kernel. 
			This version in particular, extends the compatibility with many wi-fi cards, video cards and sound cards.
			</p><br />
			
			<p><h3>HARDY HERON</h3><br />
			Version 8.04 ("Airone Ardito") was released on 24 April 2008. This version was immediately 
			noted for being distributed in two versions, one still including the branch of KDE 3.5 considered 
			to be even more stable than KDE 4, the another version already includes KDE 4 precisely 4.0.1 but 
			already by the same developers, this version is considered "limited" also because the included version 
			although it is still more "mature" than 4.0, it is absolutely not comparable to KDE 3.5.9. Precisely 
			for this reason we chose not to make Kubuntu 8.04 a LTS (Long Term Support) version, that is a 
			"long support" version unlike the Ubuntu "sister" which is an LTS version. Among the main new 
			features of this version are:<br />
			 <br />
			
			1) A modified and changed graphic aspect, always focusing on the now confirmed 
			"Crystal" theme that reaches version 1.0.5 (released on March 11th, 2008). With this version, 
			compared to the previous one, you immediately notice a brighter color of the windows title bar, 
			the close, restore, minimize buttons have a more integrated appearance in the bar. With this also 
			changes the scroll bar and the appearance of the windows characters;
			  <br />
			   <br />
			  
			 
			 2) Utility tools like the driver manager with restrictions to install device drivers not supported by 
			 the first installation such as video cards, audio, etc. are added. A program has also been included to 
			 make it easy to install visual effects such as the renowned Compiz;
			 <br />
			  <br />
			 
			This version differs from previous ones for having taken a big step forward in the recognition and management 
			of peripherals, for stability and to make it even easier to use. Important to note is that this version is the 
			first to include in the installation CD the Wubi program that allows a Microsoft Windows user to install Kubuntu 
			as a normal program within Windows, taking advantage of a virtual hard disk and without needing to create partitions 
			and modify the hard disk (the rest of the system is still executed normally). Obviously, disk access times will be 
			greater than those of an installation on a partition, and system hibernation can not be supported. Requirements are 
			256 MB of RAM, 5 GB of free space on the Windows partition and have a version of Windows between: Windows 98, ME, 
			2000, XP, Vista.
			 </p><br />
			 
			
			
			<p><h3>JAUNTY JACKALOPE</h3><br />
			Laversion of Kubuntu (including Ubuntu and other derivative versions) called "Jaunty Jackalope" (
			Lepricorno Vivace) was released on April 23, 2009, including KDE 4.2 by default. Among the new 
			features are the substitute of Adept and that is KPackageKit much easier to use less demanding 
			in terms of hardware resources and already integrated with the Qt 4 of KDE, also uses the 2.6.28
			 kernel, xorg 1.6 and the new ext4 filesystem even if the latter is optional during installation, 
			 the default file system remains the choice of Ext3 developers. Kubuntu 10.04 Netbook Edition. 
			 To use it you need at least 256 Mb of RAM, if you decide to install it requires at least 4 GB 
			 of hard disk space.</p><br />
			
			<p><h3>LUCID LYNX</h3><br />
			Kubuntu 10.04 "Lucid Lynx" ("Lince Lucida") is the first version of Kubuntu to be a LTS 
			(Long Term Support) that integrates KDE 4, now in version 4.4.2. The main novelties are the new logo, 
			Kubuntu Netbook Remix, Amarok 2.3, an improved integration of notifications, the slide installer
			 as in ubuntu 9.10 and the integration of the Firefox user interface in KDE, kernel 2.6.32 and 
			 the introduction of the animated plymouth boot graphic.
			</p><br />
			
			<p><h3>VIVID VERVET</h3><br />
			Didistributed on 23 April 2015, is based on ubuntu 15.04. Brings the new systemd boot system, 
			plasma 5 and all updated KDE apps.
			</p><br />
			
			<p><h2>Difference with Ubuntu</h2><br />
			A typical Ubuntu installation will have the Unity desktop plus other Gnome applications plus the Gnome 
			/ GTK + -based administrative tools. A typical Kubuntu installation instead has the KDE desktop with its 
			applications (like KMail) plus the KDE / Qt-based administrative tools (like Adept). You can install Ubuntu 
			and later KDE, or install the kubuntu-desktop metapackage on it. In any case, you do not have to use a single 
			collection of applications, but you can have a mixture of different applications and preferences. 
			The disadvantages of doing this are a larger space occupied in memory and on the filesystem due to 
			the different libraries (GTK / Qt), which however is almost negligible on modern computers, and the 
			different aesthetic imprint of the two solutions.<br />
			<br />
			
			<p><h2>System requirements</h2><br />
			Kubuntu supports x86 and AMD64 architectures. Minimum system requirements for a desktop 
			computer installation are: 1.5GHz x86 processor, 1GB RAM, 500GB hard disk, 1024x768 px resolution 
			video card and CD player / DVD or USB port. The minimum requirements for an installation on netbooks are: 
			RAM, 400 GB of hard disk and video card with 1024x600 px resolution with support for graphic effects. 
			If you have a computer equipped with a 64-bit processor, we recommend that you install the ì version for 
			AMD64 and have an amount of RAM equal to or greater than 2 GiB.
