			<h1>LUBUNTU</h1>
			<img id="logoDistro" src="../img/logoLubuntu.png" title="logo di Lubuntu"><br />
			<p>Lubuntu is a lightweight Linux distribution based on Ubuntu but using the LXDE desktop environment 
			in place of Ubuntu's Unity shell and GNOME desktop. LXDE is touted as being "lighter, 
			less resource hungry and more energy-efficient".<br />
			<br />
			
            <p><h2>Features</h2><br />
            QLike Xubuntu, Lubuntu is intended to be a low-system-requirement, low-RAM environment for netbooks, 
            mobile devices, and older PCs. Tests show it can use half as much RAM as Xubuntu, making it an 
            attractive choice for installing on older hardware such as being refurbished for charitable distribution.

            <p><h3>LUBUNTU 10.04</h3><br />
            On 30 December 2009 the first Alpha 1 "Preview" version ISO for Lubuntu 10.04 
            Lucid Lynx was made available for testing, with Alpha 2 following on 24 January 2010. 
            The first Beta was released on 20 March 2010 and the stable version of Lubuntu 10.04 was 
            released on 2 May 2010, four days behind the main Ubuntu release date of 28 April 2010. 
            Lubuntu 10.04 was only released as a 32-bit ISO file, but users could install a 64-bit version through 
            the 64-bit Mini ISO and then install the required packages. Lubuntu 10.04 was not intended 
            to be a long-term support (LTS) release, unlike Ubuntu 10.04 Lucid Lynx, 
            and was only going to be supported for 18 months. However, since the infrastructure of 
            Ubuntu 10.10 Maverick Meerkat (and thus Lubuntu 10.10) dropped support for i586 processors, 
            including VIA C3, AMD K6, and AMD Geode/National Semiconductor CPUs, the release of Lubuntu 
            10.10 prompted the community to extend support until April 2013 for Lubuntu 10.04, as if it were 
            a long term support version.</p><br />
            
            <p><h3>LUBUTNU 14.04 LTS</h3><br />
            Tentative plans were announced in April 2013 to make Lubuntu 14.04 a long term support release. 
            In November 2013 it was confirmed that 14.04 would be the first Lubuntu LTS release with three years of support. 
            This release also saw xscreensaver replaced by light-locker screen lock. Released on 17 April 2014, 
            Lubuntu 14.04 included just minor updates over version 13.10, along with a more featured file manager. 
            Download media for Lubuntu 14.04 is available in PC 32 bit, PC 64 bit, Mac Intel 64 bit and Mac PowerPC. 
            For early Intel Macs with a 32 bit Core solo processor, a 32-bit PC image is available. 
            In reviewing Lubuntu 14.04 LTS Silviu Stahie of Softpedia noted, "because it uses a similar 
            layout with the one found on the old and defunct Windows XP, this OS is considered to be a 
            very good and appropriate replacement for Microsoft's operating system.
            </p><br />
                        
            <p><h3>LUBUNTU 16.04 LTS</h3><br />
            Released on 21 April 2016, Lubuntu 16.04 is a Long Term Support (LTS) version, supported for 
            three years until April 2019. It is the second Lubuntu LTS version, preceded by 14.04 in April 2014. 
            This release retains the LXDE desktop and did not make the transition to LXQt, to allow LXQt to be 
            better tested in later non-LTS releases. This release is too large a file to fit on 
            a CD and requires a DVD or USB flash drive installation. Lubuntu 16.04 LTS is primarily a 
            bug-fix release and includes few new features. It does have updated artwork, however. 
            The system requirements include 512 MB of RAM (1 GB recommended) and a Pentium 4, Pentium M, 
            AMD K8 or newer CPU. The first point release, 16.04.1, was released on 21 July 2016. 
            The release of Lubuntu 16.04.2 was delayed a number of times, but it was eventually released on 17 
            February 2017. Lubuntu 16.04.3 was released on 3 August 2017. On 8 March 2017 a new version 
            of Firefox, 52.0, arrived though the update process. This version removed ALSA audio 
            support from Firefox in favour of PulseAudio, something initially not mentioned in the 
            Mozilla release notes. Since Lubuntu 16.04 LTS shipped with only ALSA audio, this broke 
            the default Lubuntu audio system in the default Lubuntu browser. In response to a bug filed, 
            Mozilla developers declined to fix the issue.
