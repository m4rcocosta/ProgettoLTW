			<h1>LINUX MINT</h1>
			<img id="logoDistro" src="../img/logoLinuxMint.png" title="Logo di Linux Mint"><br />
			<p>Linux Mint is a community-driven Linux distribution based on Debian and Ubuntu that strives 
			to be a "modern, elegant and comfortable operating system which is both powerful and easy to use."
			 Linux Mint provides full out-of-the-box multimedia support by including some proprietary software 
			 and comes bundled with a variety of free and open-source applications. The project was conceived 
			 by Clément Lefèbvre and is being actively developed by the Linux Mint Team and community.</p>
			<p>Initially, there were two Linux Mint releases per year. Following the release of Linux Mint 5 
			in 2008, every fourth release was labeled a long-term support (LTS) version, indicating that it was 
			supported (with updates) for longer than traditional releases. Versions 5 and 9 had three years of 
			support, and all LTS versions following received five years of support.</p>
			<p>Linux Mint primarily uses free and open-source software, making exceptions for some proprietary 
			software, such as plug-ins and codecs that provide Adobe Flash, MP3, and DVD playback. Linux Mint's 
			inclusion of proprietary software is unusual; many Linux distributions do not include proprietary 
			software by default, as a common goal for some Linux distributions is to adhere to the model of 
			free and open-source software.</p>
			
			<br />
			<p><h2>Linux Mint editions</h2><br />Linux Mint has multiple editions that are based upon Ubuntu, 
			with various desktop environments available. Linux Mint also has an edition based upon Debian.</p>
			<br />
			<p><h3>Ubuntu editions</h3><br />
				As of Linux Mint 13, there are two main editions of Linux Mint developed by the core development 
				team and using Ubuntu as a base. One includes Linux Mint's own Cinnamon as the desktop environment 
				while the other uses MATE. Linux Mint also develops editions that feature the KDE and Xfce desktop 
				environments by default, but these have secondary priority and are generally released somewhat later 
				than the two main editions.

				Older releases, now obsolete, included editions that featured GNOME, LXDE, and Fluxbox desktop 
				environments by default.

			<p><h4>Cinnamon</h4><br />Cinnamon is an open-source desktop environment for X-Windows systems 
			that derives from GNOME 3 but follows traditional desktop metaphor conventions. Cinnamon is the 
			principal desktop environment of the Linux Mint distribution but is available as an optional package 
			for other Linux distributions and other Unix-like operating systems as well.</p>
			<p id="livella"></p><br />
			<p><h4>MATE</h4><br />MATE is a desktop environment forked from the now-unmaintained code base of GNOME 2. 
			GNOME 3, released in April 2011, replaced the classic desktop metaphor, replacing it with its native user 
			interface: GNOME Shell. This action led to some criticism from parts of the free software community. Some 
			users refused to accept the new interface design of GNOME and called for continued development of GNOME 2. 
			An Argentine user of Arch Linux started the MATE project[5] in order to meet this demand[6] and announced 
			the availability of MATE on 18 June 2011.</p>
			<p id="livella"></p><br />
			<p><h4>XFCE</h4><br />Xfce is a free and open-source desktop environment for Unix and Unix-like operating 
			systems, such as Linux, Solaris, and BSD. Xfce aims to be fast and lightweight, while still being visually 
			appealing and easy to use. Xfce embodies the traditional UNIX philosophy of modularity and re-usability. 
			It consists of separately packaged parts that together provide all functions of the desktop environment, 
			but can be selected in subsets to suit user needs and preference. Another priority of Xfce is adherence to 
			standards, specifically those defined at freedesktop.org.</p>
			<p id="livella"></p><br />
			<p><h4>KDE</h4><br />KDE Plasma 5 is the fifth and current generation of the desktop environment created by 
			KDE primarily for Linux systems. KDE Plasma 5 is the successor of KDE Plasma 4 and was initially released on 
			15 July 2014. It includes a new default theme, known as "Breeze", as well as increased convergence across 
			different devices. The graphical interface was fully migrated to QML, which uses OpenGL for hardware acceleration 
			resulting in better performance and reduced power consumption.</p><br />

			<br />
			<p><h3>Debian editions</h3><br />
				The Debian-based edition (LMDE) uses Debian as the software source base rather than Ubuntu.
				LMDE was originally based directly on Debian's Testing branch, but is designed to provide 
				the same functionality and look and feel as the Ubuntu-based editions. LMDE has its own package repositories.

				LMDE claims certain advantages and disadvantages compared to "Mint Main" (i.e., the Ubuntu-based editions):<br />

					- LMDE is faster and more responsive than Ubuntu-based editions.<br />
					- LMDE requires a deeper knowledge and experience with Linux and Debian package management.<br />
					- Debian is less user-friendly and desktop-ready than Ubuntu, with some rough edges.
