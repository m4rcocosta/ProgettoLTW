			<p>openSUSE, formerly SUSE Linux and SuSE Linux Professional, is a Linux-based project and 
			distribution sponsored by SUSE Linux GmbH and other companies. It is widely used throughout 
			the world. The focus of its development is creating usable open-source tools for software 
			developers and system administrators, while providing a user-friendly desktop and feature-rich 
			server environment.

			The initial release of the community project was a beta version of SUSE Linux 10.0. The current 
			stable release is openSUSE Leap 42.3. The community project offers a rolling release version called 
			openSUSE Tumbleweed, which is continuously updated with tested, stable packages. This is based on the 
			rolling development code base called 'Factory'. Other tools and applications associated with the openSUSE
			project are YaST, Open Build Service, openQA, Snapper, Machinery, Portus and Kiwi.</p><br />
			
			<p><h2>History</h2><br />In the past, the SUSE Linux company had focused on releasing the SUSE Linux Personal 
			and SUSE Linux Professional box sets which included extensive printed documentation that was available for sale 
			in retail stores. The company's ability to sell an open source product was largely due to the closed-source 
			development process used. Although SUSE Linux had always been free software product licensed with the GNU General 
			Public License (GNU GPL), it was only freely possible to retrieve the source code of the next release 2 months a
			fter it was ready for purchase. SUSE Linux' strategy was to create a technically superior Linux distribution with 
			the large number of employed engineers, that would make users willing to pay for their distribution in retail stores.

			Since the acquisition by Novell in 2003 and with the advent of openSUSE, this has been reversed: starting with version 
			9.2, an unsupported one-DVD ISO image of SUSE Professional was made available for download, as well as a bootable Live 
			DVD evaluation. The FTP server continues to operate and has the advantage of "streamlined" installs, permitting the user 
			to download only the packages the user feels they need. The ISO has the advantages of an easy install package, the ability 
			to operate even if the user's network card does not work "out of the box", and less experience needed (i.e., an inexperienced 
			Linux user may not know whether or not to install a certain package, and the ISO offers several preselected sets of packages).
			
			The initial stable release from the openSUSE Project, SUSE Linux 10.0, was available for download just before the retail 
			release of SUSE Linux 10.0. In addition, Novell discontinued the Personal version, renaming the Professional version to simply 
			"SUSE Linux", and repricing "SUSE Linux" to about the same as the old Personal version. As of version 10.2, the SUSE Linux 
			distribution was officially renamed to openSUSE.

			Over the years, SuSE Linux has gone from a status of a distribution with restrictive, delayed publications (2 months of waiting 
			for those who had not bought the box, without ISOs available, but installation available via FTP) and a closed development model 
			to a free distribution model with immediate and freely availability for all and transparent and open development.

			On April 27, 2011, Attachmate completed its acquisition of Novell. Attachmate split Novell into two autonomous business units, 
			Novell and SUSE. Attachmate made no changes to the relationship between SUSE (formerly Novell) and the openSUSE project. After 
			the 2014 merger of the Attachmate Group with Micro Focus, SUSE reaffirmed their commitment to openSUSE.</p><br />

			<p><h2>Relases</h2><br />The openSUSE project aims to release a new version every eight months. Since version 11.2, 
			critical updates have been provided for two releases plus two months, which results in a support lifetime of 18 months.

			Starting with version 12.1, to add predictability and to prevent people from thinking the .0 releases are more major, 
			the openSUSE version scheme has changed. All November releases have a .1, all July releases have a .2, and all March 
			releases have a .3. Every two years, when another .1 version is released, the major version number is bumped up.

			Starting with version Leap 42.1 (after version 13.2), each major release is expected to be supported for at least 36 months, 
			until the next major version is available (e.g. 43.1), aligned with SUSE Linux Enterprise Releases. Each minor release 
			(e.g. 42.1, 42.2, etc.) is expected to be released annually, aligned with SUSE Linux Enterprise Service Packs, and users are 
			expected to upgrade to the latest minor release within 6 months of its availability, leading to a similar support lifecycle 
			of 18 months as earlier.</p><br />
