			<p>Mythbuntu was an operating system (OS) for media centers. It is based on Ubuntu and integrates, 
			as its main function, MythTV media center software; not all the programs included in Ubuntu are installed. 
			Following the principles of KnoppMyth and MythDora, Mythbuntu was designed to simplify the installation of 
			MythTV on a home theater PC. After Mythbuntu has been installed, the MythTV installer allows you to 
			configure the distribution as a frontend (a media viewer), a backend (a media server), or a combination 
			of the two. Mythbuntu aims to maintain close links with Ubuntu. The cycle of development of Mythbuntu 
			followed, until 2012, closely that of Ubuntu, with six-month releases. Starting with version 12.04, 
			Mythbuntu is released every two years, based on the Ubuntu LTS versions. On 4 November 2016, the 
			developers officially declared the project closed. Mythbuntu uses the Xfce desktop interface by default, 
			but users can install ubuntu-desktop, kubuntu-desktop or xubuntu-desktop through the Mythbuntu Control Center. 
			The only applications included in this distribution are multimedia software such as VLC, Amunix and Rhythmbox.<br />

            <p><h2>Mythbuntu Control Center</h2><br />
            The Mythbuntu Control Center has an interface that can be used to configure the system. 
            The user can select which type of system (backend, frontend, both) you wish to have installed. 
            From the control center, the user can perform common actions, such as installing plugins for MythTV, 
            configuring the MySQL database, setting passwords and installing drivers and codecs. The configuration 
            of remote controls and a number of other utilities and small programs are all performed within this program.

             <p><h3>COMPLETE INSTALLATION (FRONTEND AND BACKEND)</h3><br />
            Mythbuntu can be used to install a complete MythTV system on a single device (both as client and server). 
            The frontend is the necessary software for visual elements (or GUIs) that are used by the common user to find, 
            play and manipulate multimedia files. The backend is the server where the media files, tuners and the database 
            are actually stored. A complete backend and frontend system is advantageous for its "portability", 
            meaning that it is a stand-alone device independent of a separate server.
            </p><br />
            
			<p><h3>FRONTED INSTALLATION</h3><br />
			Mythbuntu can be used to install a MythTV client, with the frontend system only. For example, 
			users can have a central storage device (server) in their home, which can be accessed by many 
			other devices located at different points of the home, these other devices require only the 
			installation of the frontend and require, therefore , minimal hardware features. Mythbuntu can 
			also be run directly from a CD-ROM (ie without installation) as long as there is a network connection 
			to a MythTV backend server. </p><br />
