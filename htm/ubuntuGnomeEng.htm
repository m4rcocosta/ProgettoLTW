			<p>Ubuntu GNOME (formerly Ubuntu GNOME Remix) is a Linux distribution, distributed as 
			free and open-source software. It uses a pure GNOME desktop environment with GNOME Shell, 
			rather than the Unity graphical shell. Starting with version 13.04 it became an official 
			"flavour" of the Ubuntu operating system. In April 2017, it was announced that the 
			distribution will be discontinued in favor of the standard Ubuntu distribution, which is 
			switching from using Unity to GNOME as its desktop environment. The project began as an unofficial 
			"remix" because some users preferred the GNOME 3 desktop over Unity. Ubuntu GNOME 12.10 Quantal Quetzal 
			was the first stable version released on 18 October 2012. On 5 April 2017 Canonical Executive Chairman 
			and Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth announced that the mainline version of Ubuntu will move 
			from Unity to the GNOME 3 desktop starting by version 18.04 LTS, which would make it virtually 
			identical to Ubuntu GNOME. It was later revealed that Ubuntu 17.10 would in fact be the first version to use GNOME.
			
            <p><h2>Features</h2><br />
            This distribution uses as Openbox window manager and is very light and suitable even for older PCs, 
            netbook e mobile devices. A first review claims that Lubuntu uses half of the RAM used by Xubuntu 
            and from Ubuntu on a normal installation or typical use.
            Lubuntu funziona anche su computer con 256 MB di RAM. Ubuntu also works on computers with 256 MB of RAM. 
            In computers with a RAM of less than 160 MB it is advisable to install the Minimal version. 
            For a fluid use it is better to have 512 MB of RAM.
