			Ubuntu is an open source operating system for computers. It is a Linux distribution based on the Debian 
			architecture. It is usually run on personal computers, and is also popular on network servers, usually 
			running the Ubuntu Server variant, with enterprise-class features. Ubuntu runs on the most popular 
			architectures, including Intel, AMD, and ARM-based machines. Ubuntu is also available for tablets and 
			smartphones, with the Ubuntu Touch edition.
			Ubuntu is published by Canonical Ltd, who offer commercial support. It is based on free software and 
			named after the Southern African philosophy of ubuntu (literally, 'human-ness'), which Canonical Ltd. 
			suggests can be loosely translated as "humanity to others" or "I am what I am because of who we all are".
			Ubuntu is the most popular operating system running in hosted environments, soâ€“called "clouds", as it 
			is the most popular server Linux distribution.
			Development of Ubuntu is led by UK-based Canonical Ltd., a company founded by South African entrepreneur 
			Mark Shuttleworth. Canonical generates revenue through the sale of technical support and other services 
			related to Ubuntu. The Ubuntu project is publicly committed to the principles of open-source software 
			development; people are encouraged to use free software, study how it works, improve upon it, and 
			distribute it.
			<h2>Installation</h2>
			The system requirements vary among Ubuntu products. For the Ubuntu desktop release 16.04 LTS, a PC with 
			at least 2 GHz dual-core processor, 2 GB of RAM and 25 GB of free disk space is recommended. For less 
			powerful computers, there are other Ubuntu distributions such as <a href="lubuntuEng.htm" title="Lubuntu">Lubuntu</a> and <a href="xubuntuEng.htm" title="Xubuntu">Xubuntu</a>. 
			Since version 12.04, Ubuntu supports the ARM architecture. Ubuntu is also available on Power, older 
			PowerPC architecture was at one point unofficial supported, and now newer Power Architecture CPUs 
			(POWER8) are supported.

			<h2>Features</h2>
			A default installation of Ubuntu contains a wide range of software that includes LibreOffice, Firefox, 
			Thunderbird, Transmission, and several lightweight games such as Sudoku and chess. Many additional 
			software packages are accessible from the built in Ubuntu Software Center as well as any other APT-based 
			package management tools. Many additional software packages that are no longer installed by default, 
			such as Evolution, GIMP, Pidgin, and Synaptic, are still accessible in the repositories, installable 
			with the built in Ubuntu Software Center; or by any other APT-based package management tool and Snappy.
			Ubuntu operates under the GNU General Public License (GPL) and all of the application software installed 
			by default is free software. In addition, Ubuntu installs some hardware drivers that are available only 
			in binary format, but such packages are clearly marked in the restricted component.
			<h2>Releases</h2>
			Every 6 months a new Ubuntu version is released. Releases always occure in <b>April</b> and <b>October</b>.<br />
			There are two tipologies of versions distinguished by the support version, during which they will receive software updates.
			When this period is over, you will need to perform a system version upgrade or install a newer system to receive updates.

			<ul>
				<li>
					<b>LTS versions</b> (Long Term Support): support period of <b>5 years</b>.
					<div class="sottolista">
					<ol>
						<li>
							Released every 2 years in the April of the even years.
						</li>
						<li>
							Ideal in all those cases where it is expected to make a lasting installation over time
							where it is not considered of primary importance to have the entire park updated to the
							latest version. However the presence of	dedicated <b>repository</b> and the introduction 
							of <b>Snap packages</b> eases the installation of updated versions of the most popular
							software.

						</li>
						<li>
							More frequent releases than LTS versions and so with more updated software.
							This is translated in the possibility that new drivers for the usage of a new hardware are included
