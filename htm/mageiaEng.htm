			<h1>MAGEIA</h1>
				<img src="../img/logoMageia.png" title="Mageia's logo" id="logoDistro"><br />
				Mageia is a Linux based operating system, distributed as free and open source software. It is forked from the Mandriva Linux 
				distribution. The Greek term mageía (μαγεία) means enchantment, fascination, glamour, wizardry.
				The first release of the software distribution, Mageia 1, took place in June 2011.<br />
				Mageia was created in 2010 as a fork of Mandriva Linux, by a group of former employees of Mandriva S.A. and several other developers 
				and users and supporters of the Mandriva community.
				On September 2, 2010, Edge IT, one of the subsidiaries of Mandriva, was placed under liquidation process by the Tribunal de commerce 
				in Paris; effective by September 17, all assets were liquidated and employees were let go.
				The next day, on September 18, 2010, some of these former employees, who were mostly responsible for the development and maintenance 
				of the Mandriva Linux distribution, and several community members announced the creation of Mageia, with the support of many members 
				of the community of developers, users and employees of Mandriva Linux.
				<h1>Features</h1>
				The aim of the project is to fork the Mandriva linux distribution and from there create a new one
				distribution, user-oriented and with an interface well integrated with the basic system. IS
				downloadable for free and available with different Desktop environment including KDE, GNOME, Xfce e
				LXDE. He has an 18-month release cycle.<br />
				It is released in CD-Live or DVD version for both X86 and x86-64 architectures, and offers support
				for many languages, including Italian, to be selected during installation.
				We also have the Mageia Control Center (drakconf), an instrument dedicated to less experienced users,
				which allows you to manage in depth all aspects of the operating system.

				Additional software can be installed from the internet repositories with the package manager
				(rpmdrake). Here is an overview of these archives: <br />
				Core: The Core repository includes packages with open-source free-software, ie packages
				under an open-source license, the set of "Core" media as well as "Release Core" and "Updates
				Core "are available by default.<br />
				Nonfree: The nonfree repository includes packages that are free, meaning Mageia can redistribute them,
				but they contain closed-source software (hence the name - nonfree). For example this repository
				includes proprietary ATI / AMD and nVidia drivers for graphics cards, firmware for various WiFi cards,
				etc. The nonfree set is added by default, but not enabled by default. <br />
				Tainted: The Tainted repository includes packages released under a free license.
				The main criteria for placing packages in this repository is that they can violate
				patents and copyright laws in some countries, such as necessary multimedia codecs
				to play audio / video files, packages needed to play commercial video DVDs, etc.
				The Tainted set is added by default, but not enabled by default, ie it is
				completely opt-in, so check local laws before using packages from
				this repository.
