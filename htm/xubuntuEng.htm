			<h1>XUBUNTU</h1>

			<p>XXubuntu is a distribution derived from Ubuntu based on the powerful Xfce desktop environment<br />
			<br />
			
            <p><h2>Features</h2><br />
            The Xfce desktop environment is intended to use fewer system resources than the default Ubuntu 
            Unity desktop. As recently as September 2010 the Xubuntu developers claimed that the minimum RAM 
            Xubuntu could be run on was 128 MB, with 256 MB of RAM strongly recommended at that time. 
            Testing conducted by Martyn Honeyford at IBM in January 2007 on Xubuntu 6.10 concluded that 
            it "uses approximately 25 MB less application memory, and also eats significantly less into 
            buffers and cache (which may imply that there is less file activity) than Ubuntu." 
            Later testing showed that Xubuntu was at a disadvantage compared to Debian equipped with the Xfce desktop. 
            Tests were conducted by DistroWatch on a Dell Dimension 4500 desktop machine, with an Intel 2 GHz processor 
            and 384 MB of memory in April 2009, that compared Xubuntu 9.04 against an Xfce desktop version of Debian 5.0.1. 
            These showed that Xubuntu used more than twice the RAM as Debian in simple tasks. Xubuntu also ran out of 
            RAM doing everyday tasks, indicating that 384 MB of RAM was inadequate. The review concluded "It was obvious 
            I had already run out of RAM and was starting to use swap space. Considering I wasn't doing very much, 
            this was rather disappointing". Subsequent experimentation by Distrowatch concluded that the performance 
            advantages observed in Debian were due to Xubuntu's inclusion of memory-hungry software not present in 
            Debian's implementation of Xfce. Testing conducted on a later version, Xubuntu 9.10 beta, in September 
            2009 showed similar results. The tests, conducted by Linux Magazine, concluded that Xubuntu 9.10 beta's 
            RAM usage was actually greater than Ubuntu's 9.10 beta with GNOME. 
            Subsequent reviewers emphasized Xubuntu's perceived deficiencies in performance to highlight Lubuntu, 
            a project with similar goals but using the LXDE desktop environment as opposed to Xfce. For instance, 
            Damien Oh of Make Tech Easier noted in May 2010, "So what about Xubuntu? isn’t it supposed to be the lightweight 
            equivalent of Ubuntu? Sadly, that is a thing of the past. The truth is, the supposed lightweight equivalent 
            is not lightweight at all. While Xubuntu is using the lightweight XFCE desktop environment, it had been 
            bugged [sic] down by several heavyweight applications and also the integration with GNOME desktop also makes 
            it lose its advantage."

			<p><h2>Versions</h2><br />
			
            
            <p><h3>DAPPER DRAKE 6.06</h3><br />
            The version used Linux kernel 2.6.15.7 and Xfce 4.4 beta 1. Applications included the Thunar file manager, 
            GDM desktop manager, Abiword word processor and Gnumeric spread sheet, Evince PDF document viewer, Xarchiver 
            archive manager, Xfburn CD burner, Firefox 1.5.0.3 web browser, Thunderbird 1.5.0.2 email client and the GDebi 
            package manager. Caitlyn Martin reviewed Xubuntu 6.06 in June 2006. She singled out its 
            "bare bones approach" to the applications included, indicating that she would rather add applications 
            she wanted than clean out ones she didn't want. On her aging laptop Xubuntu 6.06 proved faster than Fedora Core 5. 
            She stated that: "Under Fedora when I opened a couple of rather resource intensive applications, for example 
            Open Office and Seamonkey, the system would begin to drag. While these apps still take a moment to get started 
            on Xubuntu they are crisp and responsive and don’t seem to slow anything else down. I never expected this sort of 
            performance and that alone made Xubuntu an instant favorite of mine." She had praise for the Thunar file manager, 
            as light and fast. She concluded: "Overall I am impressed and Xubuntu, for the moment anyway, is my favorite Linux 
            distribution despite a few rough edges, probably largely due to the use of a beta desktop."</p><br />
            
            <p><h3>CARMI KOALA 9.10</h3><br />
            29 October 2009 saw the release of Xubuntu 9.10, which utilized Xfce 4.6.1, Linux kernel 2.6.31 
            and by default the ext4 file system and GRUB 2. This release included the Exaile 0.3.0 music player, 
            the Xfce4 power manager replaced the Gnome Power Manager and improved desktop notifications using notify-osd. 
            Upstart boot-up speed was improved. The release promised "faster application load times and reduced 
            memory footprint for a number of your favorite Xfce4 applications thanks to improvements in library 
            linking provided by ld's --as-needed flag." Dedoimedo gave Xubuntu a negative review, saying 
            "When it comes to usability, Xubuntu has a lot to desire. While Xubuntu is based on Ubuntu, 
            which is definitely one of the friendlier, simpler and more intuitive distros around, a core 
            elements that has led to Ubuntu stardom, the integration of the Xfce desktop makes for a drastic 
            change compared to stock edition. The usability is seriously marred, in several critical categories. 
            And it gets worse. Losing functionality is one thing. Trying to restore it and ending with an unusable 
            desktop is another." The review concluded "Sadly, Xubuntu is a no go. It's not what it ought to be. What more, 
            it does injustice to the Ubuntu family, which usually delivers useful solutions, mainly to new Linux users. 
            There were horrendous, glaring problems with Xubuntu that kicked me back to Linux not so usable 2005. I was 
            taken by surprise, totally not expecting that an ultra-modern distro would pull such dirty, antiquated tricks up 
            its sleeve."[</p><br />
            
            <p><h3>PRECISE PANGOLIN 12.04</h3><br />
            Xubuntu 12.04 was released on 26 April 2012. It is a Long Term Support 
            release and will be supported for three years. This contrasts with Edubuntu, 
            Kubuntu and Ubuntu 12.04 which, while also LTS releases, will all be supported for five years. 
            Xubuntu 12.04 incorporates many changes including some default shortcuts were altered and new ones 
            added, plus there were many appearance changes, including a new logo and wallpaper. Fixes were included 
            for Greybird, Ubiquity, Plymouth, LightDM, and Terminal themes. The release shipped with the 
            Linux v3.2.14 Linux kernel. Pavucontrol was introduced to replace xfce4-mixer as it did not support PulseAudio. 
            The Alacarte menu editor was used by default. The minimum system requirements for this release are 
            512 MiB of RAM, 5 GB of hard disk space, and a graphics card and monitor capable of at least 800×600 pixel resolution.

			<p><h3>TRUSTY TAHR 14.04</h3><br />
			PXubuntu 14.04 LTS was released on 17 April 2014 and, being an LTS, features three years of support. 
			It incorporates the Xfdesktop 4.11, the Mugshot user account profile editor, the MenuLibre menu editor 
			in place of Alacarte and the Light-locker screen lock to replace Xscreensaver. The Whisker Menu is the default 
			application launching menu. The Xfdesktop also supports using different wallpapers on each workspace. 
			Jim Lynch reviewed Xubuntu 14.04 LTS and concluded: "I’ve always been a fan of Xubuntu as I tend 
			to go for lightweight desktops versus ones with a lot more glitz and features. So I was quite pleased 
			with Xubuntu 14.04. It’s true that you aren’t going to find tons of earth shattering features in this 
			release, and that’s fine because it’s a long term support release anyway. I never expect new feature overload 
			in LTS releases since the emphasis is on stability and polish. But Xubuntu 14.04 LTS is a definite improvement 
			from the last version. The overall experience has been polished up significantly, and there are some small 
			but useful features added like Mugshot, Light Locker and MenuLibre, and of course Whiskermenu."
			</p><br />
			
			<p><h3>XENIAL XERUS 16.04</h3><br />
			Released on 21 April 2016, Xubuntu 16.04 is an LTS version, supported for three years until April 2019. 
			This release offered few new features. It included a new package of wallpapers and the replacement of the 
			Ubuntu Software Center with Gnome Software, the same as in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. Reviewer Jack Wallen said, 
			"The truth of the matter is, the Ubuntu Software Center has been a horrible tool for a very long time. 
			Making this move will greatly improve the Ubuntu experience for every user." The selection of 
			wallpapers available in Xubuntu 16.04 LTS was singled out by OMG Ubuntu as "all breathtakingly beautiful". 
			The first point release, 16.04.1, was released on 21 July 2016. The release of Xubuntu 16.04.2 was 
			delayed a number of times, but it was eventually released on 17 February 2017. Xubuntu 16.04.3 was 
			released on 3 August 2017.
